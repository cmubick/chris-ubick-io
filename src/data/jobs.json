    "description": "I work on an Agile Scrum team of four developers and two QA testers. We work in fast paced, two week sprints to deliver stable, flexible and well tested code to meet business driven needs. Every story includes unit testing, monitoring considerations and security checks. The stack consists of SQL servers and .NET N-Tier web applications with MVC and AngularJS clients. Many of the applications are hosted in Azure. I focus on client code, but spend a lot of time in the middle tiers and backend. I also built and am currently the administrator for our deployment process, where we use Octopus and TeamCity for continuous integration. I am one of three members of our architecture committee where we design solutions to larger projects, this includes creating prototypes outside the .NET environment and describing in detail the return on investment possibilities of technologies like Docker, Node.js, TypeScript, and Angular 2.",
